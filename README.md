**Power BI Dashboard with Python ETL for placement data analysis**
Placement Analytics Dashboard - README

This project combines Python (ETL) and Power BI (Visualization) to analyze student placement trends.  
The workflow ensures clean, validated placement data is fed into Power BI, where interactive dashboards highlight key metrics such as recruiter activity, student hiring, salaries, and sectoral trends.

## ⚙️ Workflow  

### 1. ETL with Python (Placement dashboard-ETL.py)  
- Input: IPRS_bi.xlsx (raw placement data)  
- Process:  
  - Deletes old files in output folder  
  - Validates data (checks for null values)  
  - Exports a clean dataset to IPRS_Exported.xlsx  
- Output: Clean dataset ready for visualization  

### 2. Power BI Dashboard (IPRS dashboard overall.pdf)  
- Input: Cleaned dataset (IPRS_Exported.xlsx)  
- Interactive visuals include:  
  - Recruiter-wise hiring (Accenture, TCS, Deloitte, etc.)  
  - Package distribution (highest package ₹7.6 LPA, average ₹3.68 LPA)  
  - Recruitment by Course (B.Com, BBA, BCA, MBA, etc.)  
  - Recruitment by Sector (IT, EdTech, Healthcare, BFSI, etc.)  
  - Salary ranges (0–2 LPA, 3–5 LPA, 5–10 LPA)  
  - Gender distribution  
  - New vs Repeat Recruiters  
  - Recruitment timeline

## 🚀 How to Run  

### Step 1: Run ETL Script  
python "Placement dashboard-ETL.py"

This generates a fresh IPRS_Exported.xlsx file (clean data).  

### Step 2: Open Dashboard  
- Open Power BI Desktop  
- Load IPRS_Exported.xlsx  
- Explore the interactive visuals  

### Step 3: View Report  
For a quick look, see the exported pbix report → IPRS dashboard overall.pdf.
